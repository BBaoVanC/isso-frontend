# isso-frontend

## Goals

- Use modern technology (React.js, TypeScript) without worrying about bloat or package count
- Use dependencies rather than reimplementing them manually
- Write cleaner CSS from scratch
- Solve some issues:
  - Fetch i18n in separate request instead of bundling all languages together
  - Improve overall DOM structure
  - More organized updating of elements using React
- Add some features:
  - Allow admin/moderation from comment section page (instead of just the admin panel)
  - Use new `/config` endpoint for config -- remove client-side config

## Structure
